## SLP Gates - Flutter Perceptron Demo

**Overview:**
SLP Gates is a Flutter-based mobile app that demonstrates the functionality of single-layer perceptrons (SLPs) for simulating logic gates. This educational app allows users to explore and interact with SLPs, specifically focusing on the OR gate and the AND gate. It provides a hands-on experience for training and testing perceptrons, helping users understand the fundamentals of machine learning and artificial neural networks.

**Features:**
- **OR Gate Perceptron:** Train and predict with an SLP emulating the OR gate.
- **AND Gate Perceptron:** Train and predict with an SLP emulating the AND gate.
- **User Input:** Users can input binary values for the respective gates and observe the predicted outputs.
- **Training Functionality:** Train the perceptrons using training data, and visualize how the weights and bias evolve during training.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Get immediate predictions for given input values.
- **Intuitive Interface:** A simple and user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to interact with the app.

**How to Use:**
1. Launch the app on your mobile device.
2. Choose between the OR Gate or AND Gate Perceptron by tapping the corresponding section.
3. Enter binary input values into the text fields.
4. Train the perceptron to adjust its weights and bias based on the selected gate.
5. Predict the output by tapping the "Predict" button.
6. Observe the predicted result and gain insights into how perceptrons mimic logical operations.

**Technical Details:**
- The app is built using Flutter, a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications.
- Single-layer perceptrons (SLPs) are implemented to simulate logic gates (OR and AND gates).
- Weighted sums and activation functions are used to calculate predictions.
- Training is performed by adjusting weights and bias based on error.
